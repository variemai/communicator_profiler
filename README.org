#+OPTIONS: ^:nil num:nil

* Introduction
=mpisee= is a profiling tool for MPI that provides profiling data for the communicators of the MPI applications. To conveniently read the output of =mpisee= =mpisee-through= use to post-processes the output file for quick summary information.
* Features
- Output in a csv file
- Post-processing with /mpisee-through/
The tool provides the following data:
- For each communicator:
  1. Time spent
  2. Volume
  3. Number of calls
- Additional data:
  1. Total time of every MPI rank
  2. Node mapping of every MPI rank
* Build
1. ~CC=mpicc make~ to compile the profiling library, the shared object will be created in ~./lib~ folder.
** Dependencies
1. MPI library (openmpi,mpich) version $> 2$
2. gcc version $> 10$ that supports lto, otherwise disable lto flag in Makefile
* Usage
- Recommended: ~LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/mpisee/lib/libmpisee.so run <application>~
- You can also link your application with the =libmpisee.so= using the ~-L/path/to/mpisee/lib~ and ~-lmpisee~
  - To run with this add the ~/path/to/mpisee/lib~ to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
* Output
- The csv file consists of some lines that start with a =#= and =#@= and the rest of the data.
- Lines that start with =#= contain metadata information such as:
  - Profile date
  - MPI library version
  - Application and arguments
  - =mpisee= version
- Lines that start with =#@= contain some data information:
  - Start and end time for each process
  - Mapping of each process
