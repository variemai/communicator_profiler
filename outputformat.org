* Format of the output file of mpisee
- The output csv file consists of lines that start with '#', with '#@', and the rest of the data that start with the MPI rank number.
- Lines that start with '#' contain metadata information such as:
  - Profile start date
  - Profile end date
  - MPI library version
  - Application and arguments
  - =mpisee= version
  - =mpisee= environment vars
- Lines that start with '#@' contain information of how to read the data lines and some data information:
  - =#@mapping_l= Mapping of each process
  - =#@metric_l= denotes the type of metric used for the specific line ("VOL, TIME, NCALLS")
  - =#@msg_range_l= list of message ranges
  - =#@metric_unit_l= denotes the unit for this metric (float,int)
  - =#@comm_l= list of communicator names
  - =#@comm_sz_l= list of communicator sizes - must correspond to the list of communicator names
  - =#@call_l= list of MPI calls
  - =#@rank_start_l= list of start timestamp for each rank
  - =#@rank_end_l= list of end timestamp for each rank
- Format of a data line:
  "Rank", "Comm", "Call", "MsgSize", "Type", "Unit", "Val"
  - Rank: the corresponding MPI ranks
  - Comm: index to the communicator names list
  - Call: index to the MPI call list
  - MsgRange: index to the list of message ranges
  - Type: index to type of metric used
  - Unit: index to unit of metric used
  - Val: Value
